# CN\_GL (PHP/JS Version)

CN\_GL (Clara Nguyen's WebGL Wrapper) is a Javascript library and WebGL wrapper to aid in web-based OpenGL programming by making it be written in a fashion similar to GML's D3D. It has limited functionality, obviously, but it will make it easier to make 3D worlds and display them on your web browser.

Furthermore, I made it just to pass CS456 in College. Do not attempt to use it yourself. You'll fail.
